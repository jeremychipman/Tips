# Tips
This is the Tips Calculator by Jeremy Chipman for the iOS for Designers and Product Managers class.

This application is an exercise to complete the application to Codepath's iOS for Designers bootcamp. There is not a huge investment on design nor a lot of complex code behind it.

Time: I spent around 4 hours on the exercise itself, working alongside the tutorial video.

I hope to spend time looking into some of the optional paerts of the tip calculator before the class starts, but I wanted to at least post this required portion.

What does the app can do?

Required: The user can calculate the tip, using diferent percentages, and click to close the keyboard.
